        <pre>
(Take on me)
Take me on
(Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumblin' away
Slowly learnin' that life is okay
Say after me

It's no better to be safe than sorry
Take on me
(Take on me)
Take me on
(Take on me)
I'll be gone

In a day or two
All the things that you say, yeah
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember

You're shyin' away
I'll be comin' for you anyway
